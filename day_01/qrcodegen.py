#To create a QR code in Python, install the qrcode library using "pip install qrcode" in the command line. Then, import the library into your script using "import qrcode". Use the library to generate QR codes by providing the data you want to encode. You can customize the QR code's appearance by adjusting parameters like size and color. Additionally, you can use other libraries like Pillow and qrcodegen for advanced features like adding logos. Make sure to verify the installation by running "import qrcode" in your script.

import qrcode 
import image
qr = qrcode.QRCode(
    version = 15, #15 means the version of the QR code which means that the hight the number the complex the code
    box_size = 10, #This is the size of the QR code to be made
    border = 5 #The white part of the image
 )

data = "https://github.com/Lucky123-cloud" #My github Account, bytha follow me 
#This is the place where you input the data that QR is to be made
#If you dont want to redirect it to something, you can then just put something like
# a text that the qr code will display upon scanning something like:
# data = "Your feelings are useless here, we do it regardless" - the statement in quotes will be displayed

qr.add_data(data) #Adds the specified data to the QR code
qr.make(fit = True) #Generates the QR code. The fit=True parameter ensures the QR code fits the provided data.
img = qr.make_image(fill="black", back_color = "white") #Creates an image of the QR code with black foreground and white background.
img.save("test.png") #Saves the generated QR code image as "test.png" in the current directory.
